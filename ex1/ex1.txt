 <h1>Courses</h1>
<h2>COMP11120</h2>
<h2>This unit is the mathematics unit that covers both semesters and teaches us the most vital maths that we will need in computer science.</h2>

<h2>What I most like about the course</h2>
<h3>These are the three things that I like most about the course:</h3>

<ul>
<li>We are taught formal definitions of mathematical concepts which will help us to understand more of mathematics and gives us a broader understanding.</li>
<li>The material is very useful in computer science.</li>
<li>The lecture notes are very detailed and have plenty of examples</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I least like about the course</h2>
<h3>These are the three things that I like least about the course:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The time given in examples classes is very short and often doesn't give us much time with the TA.</li>
<li>The lecture often don't cover enough and often draw out one exercise.</li>
<li>The mathematics is possible the most difficult that I have come across and is sometimes quite difficult to understand.</li>
</ul>

<h2>COMP16121</h2>

<h2>This is the Object-Oriented Programming course which uses Java to teach us the basics of writing good programs.</h2>

<h2>What I most like about the course</h2>
<h3>These are the three things that I like most about the course:</h3>

<ul>
<li>It covers everything from the basics.</li>
<li>Whilst using Java the course aims to teach us programming in general.</li>
<li>The lecturer John Latham is very engaging which make the lectures worth attending.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I least like about the course</h2>
<h3>These are the three things that I like least about the course:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Some of the material if not all is concepts I have covered before.</li>
<li>The logbook makes exercises very tedious, and although it gets us into good practises it increases the time taken to complete even the most simple exercise.</li>
<li>The exercises sometimes are quite easy and might be better challenging us a bit more.</li>
</ul>
